Here's how to get started with your new blog:
1. **Download & Unzip Strawberry Starter**.
    - ✦ If you want to have comments, please grab it from this [Github](https://github.com/starryMirai/strawberry-starter), or follow the [comments guide](posts/example_posts/installation) on how to update an existing installation.
    - You can grab the original from [itch.io](https://bagenzo.itch.io/strawberry-starter) or [Github](https://github.com/kate-bagenzo/strawberry-starter).
    - Unzip it wherever - you can move the folder around later without issues, so don't worry.
2. **Download & Install Node**.
    - Node is a javascript runtime that lets you create things for the web.
    - Grab it from the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en).
        - Note: If you've *already* installed Node, be sure to update to the newest version.
3. **Open a Command Line in Strawberry Starter's folder**
    - Never used one? It's a program that lets you type computer commands.
        - **🪟 Windows**: Powershell is built-in, and what I recommend you use. If you're familiar with the "Command Prompt", that'll *probably* work, but it's not recommended for a variety of reasons.
        - **🍎 macOS**: The program is just called Terminal. Simple!
        - **🐧 Linux**: You definitely have it, but it's called something different depending on what kind of Linux you're running. Search for "Terminal" or "Shell".
    - You can probably open your chosen command line in the folder by right clicking the open folder and selecting "Open a Terminal", but if not, open one of these programs and type `cd path/to/template/`, where `path/to/template` is the full path you unzipped Strawberry Starter to.
4. **Execute the command: `npm install`**
    - You'll see some output, and probably some warnings and notifications. Unless you see a big ERROR, you should be okay.
    - > **🪟 On Windows**: You might get a Powershell error here! If it says you don't have permission to run scripts, then copy and paste this command:
         - > `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`
         - > You can right click -> paste this, or paste it with CTRL+SHIFT+V. Beware: command lines are finnicky and won't let you copy or paste with the usual shortcuts!
         - > Then, try `npm install` again.
         - > If that doesn't work, try again, but running Powershell as admin.

You only need to run `npm install` once to setup. Now you're ready to start blogging!

## Starting the development server
There's a live server you can run to preview your changes as you make them. It's super convenient!  
Start the server with the command `npm run dev`. Now, open [`localhost:1234`](localhost:1234/) in your browser.  
This is a preview of what your blog looks like, and it'll update automatically as you save files.
> **🪟 On Windows**: You might see a firewall permission prompt. Allow the script to bypass the firewall, or it won't work.

## Renaming & customizing your blog
Go to the `src` folder. This is where your blog's files live.  
There's a lot of stuff here, but you don't need to worry about most it! For now, let's go to `_data` and open the file named `config.jsonc`.
### A brief aside about JSON
If you've never seen a `.json` or `.jsonc` file before - don't worry, it's not complicated! It's just a way to store text so that it can be easily read by programs. The format of JSON is pretty simple: a bunch of `keys` and `values`, paired like so: `"key": "value",`. These keys and values are contained within two {curly braces}, which you'll see at the start and end of the file.

Note the quotation marks and the comma! **All of the key-value pairs (except for the last) must have a comma**. The keys and values must also be enclosed with quotation marks. Be sure not to accidentally change that while editing your config file, or your blog will stop working!

`config.jsonc` contains data that appears in a few places in your blog. Take the time now to replace the defaults, being careful not to disturb any quotation marks or commas or curly braces:
- `siteName`
    - The name of your blog. Appears on the footer, the RSS feed, and the link preview (i.e. the little image when you link to a site on social media).
- `siteDescription`
    - A small description of your blog. Appears on the RSS feed.
- `siteURL`
    - The public URL of your blog, e.g. (example.neocities.org) *Required* for the link preview and RSS feed to function correctly.
- `siteAuthor`
    - Your name. Appears on the footer and RSS feed.
- `siteLang`
    - A two-letter code indicating what language your blog is in. Used internally for various things.
- `authorLink`
    - A link to your personal website or social media. Appears on the footer. You can leave this blank if you prefer.
- `authorContact`
    -Your email. Appears on the footer. You can leave this blank if you prefer.
- `siteStyle`
    - The theme used by your blog. Themes are located in `src/assets/styles/themes/`. You can use (or edit) one of the premade themes, or create your own if you know CSS.
- `siteSubDir`
    - Set this only if you want to upload your blog to a subdirectory.
    - e.g. - set this to `/blog/` if your site will be at `example.org/blog/` instead of `example.org`.
    - This setting will automatically change all the links on your blog to work with your new subdirectory.
        - e.g. When linking images in posts, you can just do `/assets/images/example.jpg`, instead of `/blog/assets/images/bowl_of_berries.jpg`
    - **⚠️ Warning**: If you're uploading to Neocities and already have a homepage with content in it, BE SURE TO SET THIS!
        - Uploading to Neocities will OVERWRITE content like your `index.html` !
- ✦ `blueskyHandle`
    - Your bluesky handle, e.g. (user.bsky.social) Use this is you wish to have Bluesky replies as comments.
    - After publishing a post or page, link to it in a Bluesky post. From then on, any replies to that post will show up as comments
    - The comment box will look through your account for the oldest post linking to the page and use that for comments. If you delete the post you'll lose your comments, if you posted a link to the page after, that post will have its comments shown.
- ✦ `commentBoxID`
    - Set this if you're using CommentBox.io for comments. Set it to your *Project ID*, e.g. `123456789-proj`, as specified in your CommentBox dashboard.
    - The comments are tied to the URL of any given page. If you rename a post's filename, such that the URL changes, the comments will be reset (though not lost). The same will happen if you change domains.
- ✦ `commentBoxText`
    - Set this to change the color of the text used by CommentBox.io box.
### An aside about text editors
You can use whatever text editor you want to edit! I like VS Code or Notepad++, but you can even use Notepad if you want. The only important thing is that it shouldn't be a *word processor*, like Microsoft Word or Libreoffice Writer.

## Making posts
Time to write your first post! Go to `src/posts` and create a new `.md` file. You can name it whatever you want, but keep in mind that the filename will become the URL to your post (e.g. post you're reading now is named "installation.md", so if it was uploaded to `example.neocities.org`, its URL would be "`example.neocities.org/posts/installation`").  
Blog posts start with a little thing called *front matter*. It looks like this:
```
---
title: The title of the blog post goes here
date: 2025-12-25
---
```
The title appears as a header on the post page, and also on internal links (on the frontpage's "Latest posts" section and the "All posts" page).  
The date is actually optional - if it's not present, the file creation date will be used. This can cause some issues if you backup your posts somewhere and then reupload them - the file creation date might change! I highly recommend you always manually set the date.  
Create a new post now - give it a title and today's date. When you save the file, you should see it appear on the dev server.

## The index and navbar
There are some other pages on your site besides blog posts, though! You'll notice there's a navigation bar at the top of your blog with three links: `home`, `all_posts`, and `about`. These pages are all Markdown files, so editing them is similar to editing blog posts - they're just located in different places:
- The home page (index) is located at `src/index.md`.
- `all_posts.md` and `about.md` are found at `src/info`.
    - Any .md file written in the `info` folder will also appear in the navbar!
        - It won't count as a "blog post" though, so it won't appear in "Latest posts", or update the RSS Feed.
        - If you want, you can instead add a blog post to the navbar by adding `tags: navbar` to its front matter.
            - In fact, if you've noticed, this very installation guide has such a tag!
If the difference between .md files in `posts` and `info` is confusing to you, don't worry. The main difference is that only `posts` will appear in "Latest posts" or "All posts", while `info`s will only appear in the navbar.

## Favicon and Preview
There are two last things you want to customize:
- The favicon, which appears in the browser tab and bookmarks.
    - Found at `src/favicon.ico`
- The link preview, which appears when you link to your blog on some sites, like social media.
    - Found at `src/social.png`

Both of these are images you can edit in any graphics editor. Don't change their filenames or formats!

## Building and uploading your blog
To get your blog ready for uploading somewhere, go to the command line and type `npm run build`. (If the dev server is still running, you can stop it with CTRL+C first.) A folder called `_site` will appear. That folder is your completed blog, and is ready to be uploaded to whatever hosting provider you choose!

[Neocities](https://neocities.org/) is a cool hosting provider with a free tier! If you're going to use Neocities, Strawberry Starter can instead automatically upload your site there by using the command `npm run upload`! However, it requires a bit of setup, so follow these steps:
1. **[Go to your Neocities account settings](https://neocities.org/settings#sites)**
2. **Click "manage site settings", then "API".**
3. **Copy your API key**.
    - If you haven't generated an API key, do so now by pressing the button.
    - Keep this safe! Don't share it with anyone, or they can edit your site.
4. **Open the `.env` file in the base of your blog and follow its instructions.**
    - Don't edit `.env` itself! It's just a template of what your `.env.local` should look like, and should be kept that way to ensure your API key stays safe.
5. **(Optional) Set a subdirectory**
    - If you have an empty site and want your blog to live at `example.neocities.org`, then you don't need to do anything else.
    - HOWEVER, if you already have a homepage at the base of your Neocities, you can instead upload to a subdirectory like `example.neocities.org/blog/`
        - To do this, change the `siteSubDir` in `config.jsonc` to something else, e.g. `/blog/`.
    - **⚠️ Warning**: BE SURE to set this if you already have a homepage! Uploading to Neocities will OVERWRITE content, so if you already have, for example, an `index.html` page, `npm run upload` will replace it with Strawberry Starter's index. Setting a subdirectory avoids this, but just in case, you might want to make a backup of your site before running `npm run upload`.
        - You can easily back up your Neocities site by navigating to the [dashboard](https://neocities.org/dashboard) and clicking "Download entire site".

If you followed the above steps correctly, you should be able to use `npm run upload`! That command also builds your site, so if you're uploading to neocities this way, you don't need to run `npm run build`.  

## All done!
You should now have everything you need for a successful blog!  
Go forth and write an introduction post, edit the index and about pages, and upload your site!  
Oh - and don't forget to delete the `example_posts` folder in `posts`!
