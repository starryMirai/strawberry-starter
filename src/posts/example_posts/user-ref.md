This page explains how to do various things. You can find more step-by-step instructions in the installation guide, but here information is presented more simply for quick reference.

## How to use your blog
- **(Optional) Run the live preview server**
    - In a terminal that's navigated to the Strawberry Starter folder, type `npm run dev`.
    - Open a browser and go to `localhost:1234`.
    - You can now preview your changes live!
- **Adding or editing a blog post**
    - Navigate to `src/posts/` and make or edit a .md (markdown) file.
        - You can name .md files whatever, but keep in mind that the filename will be the URL to the post.
- **Building your changes**
    - In the terminal, stop the development server by pressing CTRL+C
    - Execute the command `npm run build`.
    - Your site is now built and ready for export in the `_site` folder!
        - OR, you can upload directly to Neocities with `npm run upload`! Requires some setup - see installation guide.

## Anatomy of Config.jsonc
- `siteName`
    - The name of your blog. Appears on the footer, the RSS feed, and the link preview (i.e. the little image when you link to a site on social media or discord, etc).
- `siteDescription`
    - A small description of your site. Appears on the link preview and RSS feed.
- `siteURL`
    - The public URL of your blog, e.g. (example.neocities.org) Needed for the link preview and RSS feed to function correctly.
- `siteAuthor`
    - Your name. Appears on the footer.
- `siteLang`
    - A two-letter code indicating what language your blog is in. Used internally for various things.
- `authorLink`
    - A link to your personal website or social media or etc. Appears on the footer. You can leave this blank if you prefer.
- `authorContact`
    - Your email. Appears on the footer. You can leave this blank if you prefer.
- `siteStyle`
    - The theme used by your blog. Themes are in located `src/assets/styles/themes/`. You can use (or edit) one of the premade themes, or create your own if you know CSS.
- `siteSubDir`
    - Set this only if you want to upload your blog to a subdirectory.
    - e.g. - set this to `/blog/` if your site will be at `example.org/blog/` instead of `example.org`.
    - This setting will change all the links on your blog to work with your new subdirectory.
        - e.g. When linking images in posts, you can just do `/assets/images/example.jpg`, instead of `/blog/assets/images/bowl_of_berries.jpg`
    - **⚠️ Warning**: If you're uploading to Neocities and already have a homepage with content in it, BE SURE TO SET THIS!
        - Uploading to Neocities will OVERWRITE content like your `index.html` !
- ✦ `blueskyHandle`
    - Your bluesky handle, e.g. (user.bsky.social) Use this is you wish to have Bluesky replies as comments.
    - After publishing a post or page, link to it in a Bluesky post. From then on, any replies to that post will show up as comments
    - The comment box will look through your account for the oldest post linking to the page and use that for comments. If you delete the post you'll lose your comments, if you posted a link to the page after, that post will have its comments shown.
- ✦ `commentBoxID`
    - Set this if you're using CommentBox.io for comments. Set it to your *Project ID*, e.g. `123456789-proj`, as specified in your CommentBox dashboard.
    - The comments are tied to the URL of any given page. If you rename a post's filename, such that the URL changes, the comments will be reset (though not lost). The same will happen if you change domains.
- ✦ `commentBoxText`
    - Set this to change the color of the text used by CommentBox.io box.

## Commands
- `npm install`
    - This installs dependencies that your blog needs to function.
    - You only need to run this once, to create the `node_modules` folder.
        - If that folder is deleted (e.g. you got rid of it to back up your blog somewhere) you'll need to run this command again to build or use the dev server.
- `npm run dev`
    - This command starts a development server at [localhost:1234](localhost:1234).
    - It live updates with any changes you make, so it's good to run this while writing to see a preview of your blog.
- `npm run build`
    - This command outputs your blog's files to the `_site/` folder.
- `npm run upload`
    - This command will build your site (as if you had typed `npm run build`), and then upload your site directly to Neocities.
    - However, it won't work out of the box. Check the [installation guide](/posts/example_posts/installation) and the `.env` file for more info.

### Detailed Folder Layout Reference
Here's an overview of the folders and files in Strawberry Starter. You can ignore most of these and have a perfectly functional blog, but if you're curious and/or brave:
- `_functions/`
    - Contains various scripts run by Node during the site's build and install.
- `_site/`
    - Destination folder for your finished site after running `npm run build` or `npm run upload`.
- `node_modules/`
    - Contains various Node packages and dependencies.
- `src/`
    - `_data/`
        - `config.jsonc`
            - Contains various variables used throughout your blog.
    - `_includes/`
        - Contains HTML files that create the layout of your blog.
        - These files also use Liquid, a templating language.
    - `assets/`
        - An assorted folder for storing things like images or scripts or styles. Anything placed in this folder will automatically be copied over to `_site/` when you run the `build` or `upload` command.
    - `info/`
        - Contains pages that will appear on the navbar at the top of your blog. By default, you have two: `all_posts` and `about`.
        - If you want to add a new navbar section to your blog, add a .md file here.
    - `posts/`
        - Contains blog posts.
        - If you want to add a new blog post, add a .md file here.
    - `index.md`
        - This is the homepage of your blog.
- `social.png`
    - This image appears in the preview card used when linking to your blog on social media.
- `.env`
    - This is a template explaining what a proper `.env.local` file should look like.
- `.env.local`
    * This file isn't created by default (for security reasons).
    * Putting your Neocities API key here is necessary for `npm run upload` to work.
- `.gitignore`
    * Files ignored by git. If you know how to use git, then this is useful to you. If not, don't worry about it.
- `eleventy.config.js`
    * Config file for 11ty.
- `package.json`
    * Config file for Node.
- `README.md`
    * A very simple explanation of how to use your blog.
    - This also contains a changelog detailing bug fixes/changes.
        - You can see what version you're on by checking `package.json`.

Since you looked, if you're **really** curious... why not go to [the 11ty homepage](https://www.11ty.dev/) and learn even more about how it works? This template is pretty basic and only scratches the surface. A warning, though - if you want to do something really complicated, you're probably better off starting from scratch!

## Node
Strawberry Starter was made with Node version # `20.18.1`. Running on lower versions may cause bugs.  
You can see your Node version by typing `node -v` into a command line.
